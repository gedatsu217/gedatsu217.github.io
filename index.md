# Projects
## Wearbo
Wearbo is a wearable keyboard for future devices. It is difficult to input characters with wearable devices such as a smartwatch and AR glasses, but wearbo solves this problem and helps users to input characters without stress.

We won the prize at Todai To Texas, which is a program that assists students in going to SXSW and exhibiting their products (The University of Tokyo is called "Todai" in Japan), so we planed to go to SXSW2020, but it has been canceled because of Coronavirus.

It has been exibited at [GUGEN](https://gugen.jp/) (The competition of invention held in Japan. we won 2nd prize.) and [iREX](https://biz.nikkan.co.jp/eve/irex/) (The exihibition of robot held in Japan).
